这是一个 Autohotkey 写自动备份程序，可以设置参数，每 15 分钟一次， AHK 可以做为一个 daemon 程序挂在那儿。

# Backup Buddy v0.9

*Status: Not maintained anymore. Any improvements whatsoever now occur in: [dufferzafar/win-butler](https://github.com/dufferzafar/win-butler/blob/master/Data/buddy/backup.ahk)*

A script to automatically backup your folders.

You can specify a list of folders that'll be compressed (using 7Zip) and then backed up every 15 minutes or so (you can modify the setting) to your backup folder (you can specify where you want your backups to be saved).

[This](http://dufferzafar.engineerinme.com/blog/when-life-gives-you-lemons) is what made me write the script.

<!-- Five snapshots of the backups are maintained. So the older ones are deleted as the new ones pop in. -->

## <a name="install"></a>Installation

Firstly, you'll need to have [Autohotkey](http://l.autohotkey.net/AutoHotkey_L_Install.exe) installed.

Once you've done that, download the [zip](https://github.com/dufferzafar/backup-buddy/archive/master.zip), extract the contents.

You are now ready to use the script, but before you do that, read on...

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage Instructions

As of now, you'll have to manually edit the script to add the paths of the folders that you want to backup.

You'll also need to specify the path of the folder where the backups will be kept.

While you are at it, there are a few other settings that you can tweak too like the number of backups you want to keep (default five),
the password that'll be used to protect the backups (deafult: No password is used.)

Do that and run the script - backups will be performed at the period you've specified (default fifteen).

You can right-click the application's icon in tray menu to Pause/Resume Backups.

You can also Open the backups directory from the tray menu.

Have Fun!
